            Roblox is an online game platform and game creation system developed by Roblox Corporation that allows users to program and play games created by themselves or other users.
            Created by David Baszucki and Erik Cassel in 2004 and released in 2006, the platform hosts user-created games of multiple genres coded in the programming language Lua.Early
            in Roblox's history, it was relatively small, both as a platform and as a company. Roblox began to grow rapidly in the second half of the 2010s, and this growth was 
            accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic.[11][12]Roblox is free to play, with in-game purchases available through a virtual currency called Robux.As of August 2020, Roblox had 
            over 164 million monthly active users, including more than half of all American children under 16.[13][14] Although Roblox has received generally positive reviews from critics,
            it has faced criticism for its content moderation, microtransactions, and allegations of exploitative practices toward children.</p>

    <p style="color: wheat;"> allows users to create and publish their own games, which can then be played by other users, by using its game engine, Roblox Studio.[15] Roblox Studio includes multiple premade game templates,[16][17] as well as the Toolbox, which allows access to user-created models, plugins, audio, images, meshes, video, and fonts. [18][19] Games, officially referred to as "experiences" on the platform,[20][21] are scripted with Lua'u', a dialect of the Lua programming language, while C++ is used for background processes such as memory management.[22][23][better source needed] A derivative of Lua 5.1, Luau supports gradual typing and is designed to maximize performance.[24][16][17][25] Luau has been released under the MIT License since November 2021.[26][non-primary source needed]

        Users are able to create purchasable content through one-time purchases, known as "game passes", as well as microtransactions that can be purchased more than once, known as "developer products".[27][28] As of 2020, Roblox reported that more than 2 million developers used Roblox Studio to create more than 20 million games per year. A majority of developers were minors, and roughly 345,000 earned money through Roblox's Developer Exchange program.[29][13]</p>
